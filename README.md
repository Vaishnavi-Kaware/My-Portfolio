Very Simple Portfolio (literally very simple)
A very simple portfolio page made with HTML, CSS & JS.
First of all, this is my first open source project. So please show me some respect and star my project. ðŸ¤ 
Used isotope, typed, owlcarousel, and more stuff.
Responsive & mobile-friendly. (I think so ðŸ¤ )
And yes, it's not very pleasing to the eyes, I know.
